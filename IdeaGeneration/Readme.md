# Idea Genration For Hybrid ClassRoom For Under Prviliege Schools

# Core Problem-Double Diamond FrameWork
  
We all Know that how pandemic make our life difficult we face many problems. One of the main problem is that childern living in underprivilege areas are unable to go to schools and they cannot continue thier studies because lack of facilities and teacher teaching in underprivilege area face many problems.
  
   1. Lack Of technologies
   2. No or least teacher training
   3. Lack of study materials
   4. Lack of resources.

These are the some problem we disscussed above.



## Final 10 Ideas:

•	Virtual classes (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet)

Virtual Classes can be used and the use of whiteboard such as Google Jam board can do the right job, it helps the students to interact with teacher and to learn more affectively, as almost all three platforms are free and student just need a working internet connection and a smartphone or a basic computer.

•	Centers (Mentimeter, Socrative)

For the Assessments and Quizzes these two platforms are best for the hybrid learning, as these platforms are user-friendly and whole class both the students In person an Virtual can attempt the quiz and assessment at the same time.

•	Collaboration Tools (Google Docs, Google Slides)

Students can work on research and assignments together, can make group together and work together communicating inside of one document or slide presentation at the same time, all students can share their ideas in same document with each other.

•	Online Learning Portal

As we all know that under privilege schools not have good infrastructure and less funds, so in that case online learning portal can resolve the hybrid learning problem, Almost all schools have same curriculum from grade 1 to 8, an online learning portal can be used by both physical and virtual students, as it can manage student learning hours, quizzes, assignments, marked games and activities, reading exercises and fair assessments.

• Outside of the classroom, practise project-based learning
Students are locked inside their homes because it is COVID time, so you can have them practise project-based learning. For example, you can ask students to start by sharing any recent household chores they've completed; some students may have done laundry, and they can record themselves doing so. Such a teaching method will improve students' learning and thinking abilities without them even realising it. There are numerous other projects that can be used to teach fundamental concepts that students can apply naturally.

• Web-based Meeting Rooms
Another component of hybrid learning is tools for effective small-group work. Teachers can use these methods to divide students into groups for discussions, project work, and more. The teacher can divide the students into small groups, each of which has its own "room" in which to discuss a concept or work on a project. Teachers can also keep an eye on what's going on in all of the classrooms.

• Visualization software
Tools that allow students to share their knowledge in ways other than words and numbers. Many current whiteboarding or visual mapping solutions allow users to express their thoughts using sketches, photos, videos, and other media. Others have layers and connectors that allow students to demonstrate complex relationships between concepts. Tools that make it simple for students to collaborate asynchronously or in real time. This expands the realm of visualisation to include visual collaboration. Allow students to map out their understanding of a scientific concept or share a visual representation of a literary theme in small or large groups. Students gain a better understanding of how their ideas intersect and differ by working together.

•	Guided Instructions

Teacher can keep both the in person and virtual students engaged at the same time, assignment for physical students and guided instruction for virtual students, and switch the process assignment for virtual students and guided instructions for physical students.

•	Game base Learning System

In person and virtual students can engage at the same time is by using games where everyone response in a same way, no matter whether they are learning in the classroom or virtually, it helps to make the student responsive, simple call out games, small problems and puzzles are good for student brain storming
