•	Having the option of attending school remotely makes education more convenient for certain student, such as students who have health, travelling, and distance from school. The elements of high-quality instruction are the same, regardless of how the lessons are delivered in person, online, or both. In all cases, students learn more effectively and are more engaged in their education when they are actively learning, as opposed to simply watching a video or listening to the teacher talk. Students need the opportunity to analyze content, work collaboratively, and solve problems.
