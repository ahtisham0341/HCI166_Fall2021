## History Of HCI

### Introduction
    
    Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. Because human-computer interaction examines the interaction between a human and a machine, it draws on knowledge from both the machine and the human side. Techniques in computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages are all relevant on the machine side. Communicatio, graphic design, social sciences, psychology, and human performance are all relevant on the human side.

### Human
    The users of computers are humans. When it comes to HCI, it's important to think about what users want and need, their abilities and limitations, how their perception work, and what they find appealing and pleasurable when using computers. When humans interact with computers, they bring a great deal of experience. Designers must figure out how to make products appealing without diverting users' attention away from their tasks.

### Computer
    A computer operates in a much more obfuscated manner.The information and operations performed by a computer are represented inside the computer in a form that we can not see. Binary digits encoded as two levels of electrical charge. Any user feedback that is required must be carefully planned and programmed.
