## History Of HCI

### Introduction
    
   Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. Because human-computer interaction examines the interaction between a human and a machine, it draws on knowledge from both the machine and the human side. Techniques in computer graphics, operating systems, programming languages are all relevant on the machine side. Communicatio, graphic design, social sciences, psychology, and human performance are all relevant on the human side.

### Human
   The users of computers are humans. When it comes to HCI, it's important to think about what users want and need, their abilities and limitations, how their perception work, and what they find appealing and pleasurable when using computers. When humans interact with computers, they bring a great deal of experience. Designers must figure out how to make products appealing without diverting users' attention away from their tasks.

### Computer
   A computer operates in a much more obfuscated manner.The information and operations performed by a computer are represented inside the computer in a form that we can not see. Binary digits encoded as two levels of electrical charge. Any user feedback that is required must be carefully planned and programmed.
    
### History
 
###### The rise of the personal computer in the 1970s.

   At the end of the 1970s, a broad project of cognitive science had emerged, encompassing psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, and philosophy of mind.


###### Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the 1980s.

   The Graphical User Interface is a computer interface that is designed to make it easier for users to understand. Before GUI, computers were given commands via a command prompt. GUI introduced a graphical user interface that is simple to use, perceive, and visualize, and it improved the ability to work.

###### The Internet and Collaborative Works in the 1990s.

   In the 1990s, the Internet began its journey. As a result, people were able to communicate more easily. As a result, many new technologies for better communication have emerged.
 
###### Mobile Computing in the 2000s and Beyond

The world of today is ruled by computers, mobile phones, laptops, and smart phones. They provide people with a variety of services such as SMS, multimedia, games, email, internet, chatting, video conferencing, GPS, and so on.
