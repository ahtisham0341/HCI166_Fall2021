Im Ahtisham Ali 62976 student of final year BsCs at PAF-KIET, Im also doing my FYP-1, Im very straight forward and introvert in behavior and there are two main reason to get enrolled in HCI first one that this course is prerequisite for FYP-2 and the second is that it helps me to improve my knowledge about Ui and user computer interactions.

I'm Faiq Nasir 62954 student of BSCS final year from PAF KIET university, Personality wise I'm a person who loves challenges in life and always looking forward solve them the best way possible, moreover I'm a team player who loves to help his team succeed in life with him together. Talking about the course HCI , I've been learning alot about the new ways to help users interact with computers from different perspective either with help of designing or skills which are unique in nature. It definately helps me in expanding
my knowledge about user computer interations.
